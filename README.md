# Predicting-Stock-Movements

This project aims to predict stock movements trends (classifying them as an upwards or downwards trend), using various **machine learning models**. 

The chosen dataset provides data of about 8.4K companies on their daily stock prices from years 2009 to 2017, scrapped from popular reliable stock exchange platforms like NYSE, NASDAQ, and NYSE MKT.
